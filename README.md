## Overview

This project is a **Netflix Clone** built using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).** It mimics the core functionalities of Netflix, allowing users to sign up, log in, view trending movies and TV shows, watch trailers, search for actors and movies, and keep a search history. All functionalities are authenticated using **JWT (JSON Web Token).**

The application also features a responsive UI, optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Users can navigate through the application, watch videos, and view detailed information about movies or TV shows, and manage their search history.

### Key Features

- 🔐 User authentication with JWT (JSON Web Token)
- 🎬 Fetch and display movies & TV shows (Now Playing, Top Rated, Popular, Upcoming categories)
- 🔎 Search for movies, TV shows, and actors
- 📱 Fully responsive UI (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)
- 🎥 Watch movie trailers directly on the platform
- 📜 Search history tracking (and management)
- 🐱‍👤 Recommendations of similar movies/TV shows
- 💙 Awesome landing page design with smooth animations and video integration
- 💾 Fullstack MERN implementation with secure backend routes

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:

- **React.js**: Used for building the dynamic, responsive user interface.
- **React Router:** For navigation and routing between different pages in the application.
- **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
  Lucide React: Icon library used to display beautiful icons (e.g., Play, Info).
- **Zustand:** A small, fast state management library used to manage global state in the app.
- **React Player:** Used for embedding and playing videos like movie trailers.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for responsive design and styling.
- **React Hot Toast:** For showing notifications, such as errors and success messages (e.g., account creation success).

### Backend:

- **Node.js:** Used as the runtime environment for running the backend server.
- **Express.js:** A lightweight web application framework for handling routes, middleware, and API logic.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing user data, movie information, and search history.
- **Mongoose:** ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for interacting with MongoDB from Node.js.
- **bcryptjs:** For hashing passwords securely.
- **jsonwebtoken (JWT):** For handling user authentication securely.
- **Cookie-Parser:** Middleware for handling cookies, particularly for storing JWT tokens.
